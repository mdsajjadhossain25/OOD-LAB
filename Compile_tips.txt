1. Compile all Java files inside the package folder:

   javac packageName/*.java

2. Run the Java file containing the main method (use fully qualified class name):

   java packageName.MainClass

✅ In a single .java file, only one public class is allowed (the one matching the filename), and the others should have default (package-private) access (i.e., no public keyword).
✅ If each class is in its own file, then they can each be declared public.
