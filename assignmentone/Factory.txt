3️⃣ Notification System (Factory Pattern):
We use the Factory Design Pattern to create different types of notifications (SMS, Email, Push) based on input. The factory decides which notification object to instantiate.

✅ Factory pattern centralizes object creation logic and hides instantiation details from the client.

👉 Why?
It makes the system scalable and easier to maintain when adding new notification types
