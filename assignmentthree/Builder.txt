 1️⃣ Car Customization System (Builder Pattern):
We use the Builder Design Pattern to create car objects step by step, allowing flexible configuration of attributes like model name, engine type, color, transmission, sunroof, and infotainment system.

✅ Builder pattern helps construct complex objects by chaining setter methods without needing multiple constructors.

👉 Why?
It simplifies object creation when many optional parameters exist.
